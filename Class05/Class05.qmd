# Background

There are many graphic systems available in R. These include "base" R and tones of add on packages like **ggplot2**.

Let's compare "base" and **ggplot2** briefly. We can use some example data that is built-in with R called `cars`:

```{r}
head(cars)
```

In base R I can just call `plot()`

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

How can we do this with **ggplot2**

First we need to install the package. We can do this `install.packages("ggplot2")`. I only need to do this once then it will be available on my computer from then on.

> Key point: I only install packages in the R console not within quarto docs of R scripts.

Before I use any add-on package I must load it up with a call to `library()`

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cars)
ggplot(cars)
```

Every ggplot has or need at least 3 things/layers:

- **data** (in our case `cars`)
- **aes**thetics (how the data map to the plot)
- **geom**etry (geom) that determine how the map is drawn (lines, points, columns, etc.)

```{r}
ggplot(cars) + 
  aes(x=speed, y=dist)
```
```{r}
ggplot(cars) + 
  aes(x=speed, y=dist) +
  geom_point()
```

For "simple" plots ggplot is much more verbose than base R but the defaults are nicer and for complicated plots it has become more efficient and structured.

## Using different aes and geoms

>Question: How to add a line to show the relationship of speed to stopping distance. (i.e. add another "layer")?

```{r}
p <- ggplot(cars) + 
  aes(x=speed, y=dist) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, method="lm")
```

fn + f1 on commands to see help commands. geom_smooth(se=FALSE) removes the StDev area
I can always save any ggplot object (i.e. plot) and use it later for adding more layers

```{r}
p
```

>Question: How to add a title and subtitle to the plot?
- Hint: Use ChatGPT when you need help to search up commands

```{r}
p + labs(title="My first ggplot", 
         subtitle = "Stopping distance of old cars", 
         caption = "BIMM143",
         x="Speed (MPG)",
         y="Stopping distance (ft)") +
  theme_bw()
```

## Gene expression plot

Read input data into R
```{r}
url <- "https://bioboot.github.io/bimm143_S20/class-material/up_down_expression.txt"
genes <- read.delim(url)
head(genes)
```

> Question: How many genes are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(genes)
```

> Question: How many columns are there?

```{r}
ncol(genes)
```

> Question: What are the column names?

```{r}
colnames(genes)
```

> Question: How many "up" and "down" regulated genes are there?

Using different aes and geoms

```{r}
table(genes$State)
```

## Custom Color Plot
> Question: Make a first plot of this data

```{r}
ggplot(genes) + 
  aes(x=Condition1, y=Condition2, col=State) +
  scale_color_manual( values=c("red","burlywood4","yellow")) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title="Gene expression changes upon drug treatment",
       x="Control (no drug)",
       y="Drug treated")+
  theme_bw()
```
# Using different geoms

Let's plot some aspects of the in-built `mtcars` dataset.
```{r}
head(mtcars)
```


> Question: Scatter plot of `mpg` vs `disp`

```{r}

p1 <-ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "MPG vs Displacement", x = "Displacement", y = "MPG")
``` 
> Question: boxplot of `gear` vs `disp`

```{r}
p2<-ggplot(mtcars) +
  aes(gear, disp, group=gear) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

> Question: barplot of `carb`

```{r}
p3<-ggplot(mtcars) +
  aes(carb) +
  geom_bar()
```

> Smooth of `disp` vs `qsec`

```{r}
p4<-ggplot(mtcars) +
  aes(disp, qsec)+
  geom_smooth()
```
I want to combine all these plots into one figure with multiple plannels.

We can use the **patchwork** package to do this

```{r}
library(patchwork)

( (p1 / p2 | p3) / p4)
```

```{r}
ggsave(filename="myplot.png", width=10, height=10)
```
 
 ## Faceting
```{r}
# File location online
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jennybc/gapminder/master/inst/extdata/gapminder.tsv"
```

```{r}
gapminder <- read.delim(url)
```


```{r}
head(gapminder)
```

> Question: How many countries are in this dataset?

```{r}
length(table(gapminder$country))
```

> Question: Plot gdpPercap vs lifExp color by continent

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder) +
  aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp, col=continent) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.3) +
  facet_wrap(~continent) +
  theme_bw()
```
